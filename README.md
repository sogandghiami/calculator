# calculator
This is a simple Command-Line Calculator built with Python.

It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation — through a text-based menu.
Each calculation is saved in a local JSON file (history.json) so users can review their previous calculations anytime.

## Features

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power operations

Input validation (prevents invalid numbers and division by zero)

Interactive text menu

Persistent history saved in history.json using Python’s pathlib and json modules

Clean and modular code written with functions

## Concepts Practiced

File handling with Path (modern alternative to open())

Data storage and retrieval using JSON

While loops for continuous interaction

Dictionaries for cleaner logic (operation mapping)

Modular programming with reusable functions
